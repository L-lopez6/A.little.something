# Why Poetry?
My name is L, and I call myself a poet. Poetry is an outlet for me, and a huge way in which I like to express myself. I like that poems can be short and simple, but also long and complex. Although I struggle to express myself through words, I find that the freedom that comes with writing poems makes me feel less restrained and allows me to speak my mind.

I began writing in the year 2020. I write poems about anything going on in my life. Some of them are very personal, and others are not so important. I never know where to store my poems, so in a way, this is my little portfolio about just a few of my poems, a little drop of my thoughts.

# Little bits about me
## Swimming
I hold on to the edge

my feet ready to kick off,

knees up to my chest

I get ready to push off

1

remember to hold your nose

2

close your eyes

3

hold your breath and

P

  U
  
     S
     
       H
       
I shoot through the water

pinch my nose to avoid inhaling it

savor the few seconds of silence

as my ears go underwater


I stand up

for a breath of air

then go to do it again
