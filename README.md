# Why Poetry?
My name is L, and I call myself a poet. Poetry is an outlet for me, and a huge way in which I like to express myself. I like that poems can be short and simple, but also long and complex. Although I struggle to express myself through words, I find that the freedom that comes with writing poems makes me feel less restrained and allows me to speak my mind.

I write poems about anything going on in my life. Some of them are very personal, and others are not so important. I never know where to store my poems, so in a way, this is my little portfolio about just a few of my poems, a little drop of my thoughts.
