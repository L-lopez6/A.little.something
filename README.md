# Why Poetry?
My name is L, and I call myself a poet. Poetry is an outlet for me, and a huge way in which I like to express myself. I like that poems can be short and simple, but also long and complex. Although I struggle to express myself through words, I find that the freedom that comes with writing poems makes me feel less restrained and allows me to speak my mind.

I began writing in the year 2020. I write poems about anything going on in my life. Some of them are very personal, and others are not so important. I never know where to store my poems, so in a way, this is my little portfolio about just a few of my poems, a little drop of my thoughts.

# Simple poems
## About my significant other, friends, and bits of my life
### Look
Black rimmed eyes  
messy hair  
random clothes  
sleepy eyes  
tired body  
  
*This poem is about looking messy and feeling tired.*

### Safe and Happy
With them,  
everything feels okay  
my friends are always there  
and they know  
the buttons to push to make me laugh  
and the words to say to make me feel okay  
I hope they never leave my side  

*My friends are very important people to me, they have helped me get through tough times and I am very grateful for them.*
