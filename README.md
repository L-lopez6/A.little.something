# Why Poetry?
My name is L, and I call myself a poet. Poetry is an outlet for me, and a huge way in which I like to express myself. I like that poems can be short and simple, but also long and complex. Although I struggle to express myself through words, I find that the freedom that comes with writing poems makes me feel less restrained and allows me to speak my mind.

I began writing in the year 2020. I write poems about anything going on in my life. Some of them are very personal, and others are not so important. I never know where to store my poems, so in a way, this is my little portfolio about just a few of my poems, a little drop of my thoughts. And of course, all of these poems are my own, they are original.

This picture, with the flowers on a poetry book, gives me the aesthetic that I think of when I think of poetry.

# Simple poems
## About my significant other, friends, and bits of my life
### Look (9/2/22)
Black rimmed eyes  
messy hair  
random clothes  
sleepy eyes  
tired body  
  
*This poem is about looking messy and feeling tired.*

  
### Yummy Food (9/16/22)
Bread  
cheese  
garlic  
yummy  
you always know  
all the right things to do 

*My boyfriend gave me a yummy bread from the bakery 85Â°C and I very much enjoyed it.*

### Safe and Happy (10/3/22)
With them,  
everything feels okay  
my friends are always there  
and they know  
the buttons to push to make me laugh  
and the words to say to make me feel okay  
I hope they never leave my side  

*My friends are very important people to me, they have helped me get through tough times and I am very grateful for them.*

### ASMR (10/3/22)
nail tapping  
lowest brightest setting  
it's almost 12 am  
drowsy eyes  
whispering in my ear  
as I drift off,  
and sleep peacefully  

*I watch ASMR videos when I cannot sleep, here is one of my favorite ASMR videos:* [Luna Bloom's ASMR!](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zScMsTqgt6I)

## Picnic date
pink purple flowers  
a blue sky  
and a shining sun  
when it's just the two of us  
nothing else matters  
and I forget my worries  

*My boyfriend got me flowers recently, and they were very pretty.*
